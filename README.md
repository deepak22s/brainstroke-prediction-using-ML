# Stroke Prediction Models

This repository explores the effectiveness of various classification models in predicting stroke occurrences. We evaluated popular models including XGBoost, CatBoost, LightGBM, Bagging, and ExtraTrees classifiers. Each model's accuracy is detailed below:

- ExtraTrees Classifier: 99.8%
- Bagging Classifier: 98.5%
- CatBoost Classifier: 97.7%
- XGBoost Classifier: 96.3%
- LightGBM Classifier: 91.8%

Explore our research findings and methodologies to understand efficient stroke prediction techniques.
